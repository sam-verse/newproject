## Features

### Data Preprocessing
* Handles missing values (median for numeric, mode for categorical)
* Encodes categorical variables using Label Encoding
* Standardizes features using StandardScaler
* Creates engineered features for better prediction

### Feature Engineering
* **Irrigation Ratio**: Proportion of irrigated land to total agricultural land
* **Non-Agricultural Income Flag**: Binary indicator for diversified income
* **Credit Exposure & Credit Flag**: Enhanced financial risk assessment
* **Weather Stability**: Standard deviation of rainfall across years
* **Agricultural Performance Trend**: Average and maximum agricultural performance
* **Infrastructure Index**: Combined measure of electricity and housing quality
* **Socio-Economic Score**: Average village socio-economic indicators
* **Agricultural Intensity**: Total area and diversity metrics

### Models Implemented (Optimized)
1. **Ridge Regression** - L2 regularization with optimized alpha
2. **Random Forest** - 200 estimators with tuned parameters
3. **Gradient Boosting** - 150 estimators with optimal learning rate

### Model Selection

## Key Features of the Solution

1. **Comprehensive EDA**: Explores data distribution, missing values, and target statistics
2. **Robust Preprocessing**: Handles various data quality issues
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creates meaningful derived features
4. **Model Comparison**: Tests multiple algorithms systematically
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizes the best model
6. **Feature Importance**: Analyzes which features drive predictions
7. **Validation**: Uses proper train/validation split for unbiased evaluation

## Expected Output

The script will:
1. Load and explore the training data
2. Preprocess and engineer features
3. Train and compare multiple models
4. Select and tune the best model
5. Evaluate performance on validation data
6. Generate feature importance plots
7. Display final MAPE score

## For Test Data Prediction

To make predictions on test data, uncomment and modify the prediction section in the main() function:

```python
# Load test data
test_data = predictor.load_data('test_data.csv')
X_test, _ = predictor.preprocess_data(test_data, is_training=False)
predictions = predictor.predict(X_test)

# Save predictions
submission = predictor.create_submission_file(test_data, predictions)
```

## Competition Requirements Met

âœ… **Python Code**: Complete .py file for income prediction  
âœ… **MAPE Evaluation**: Primary metric for model performance  
âœ… **Methodology**: Clear approach with feature engineering and model selection
